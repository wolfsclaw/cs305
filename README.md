<b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?</b><br>
<br>
Artimes Financial is looking for ways to ensure that their software is secure, and if not, how to fix it to ensure that it is.<br>
<br>
<b>What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?</b><br>
<br>
I found that researching the vulnerabilities and how to suppress those vulnerabilities was fairly simple when I figured out how to do it properly.  Coding securely is important as it helps to let the client know that you are looking out for their best interests.  Software security helps to gain trust and ensure that the customer is certain that they have the ability to operate their business without the worry of malicious attacks.<br>
<br>
<b>Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b><br>
<br>
Seeing the different ways that the way you code can create so many vulnerabilities was amazing to me.  I had no idea that their were so many ways that applications were vulnerable.<br>
<br>
<b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b><br>
<br>You increase layers of security by reading the vulnerability report and ensuring that you have updated all the vulnerabilities.  In the future I will use the vulnerability report and ensure that everything is within the newest standards.<br>
<br>
<b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b><br>
<br>
I was not able to make sure that the code was absolutely secure.  I was missing a piece somewhere in figuring out how to make my website secured.  Aftor refactoring the code, I ran the vulnerability report several times to ensure that there were no new vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
<b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b><br>
<br>
Having the knowledge of how to do the vulnerability report was very helpful to understanding where the vulnerabilities lie.  This is crucial to helping to make sure that the software you are creating is secure.<br>
<br>
<b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b><br>
<br>
I would show employers that I have the ability to run the proper reports and to the ability to fix them, so that there software is secure.
